A createTask method from an [educational To-Do project](https://github.com/yaufol/todo-list/blob/master/src/App.js) written in React.

```javascript
createTask() {
		if (this.state.draftTaskValue !== "") {
			this.setState(
				{
					tasks: this.state.tasks.concat({
						text: this.state.draftTaskValue,
						created: Date.now(),
						done: false
					}),
					draftTaskValue: "",
					Snackbar: {
						open: true,
						message: 'task "' + this.state.draftTaskValue + '" has been added'
